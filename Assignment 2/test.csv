( by taking demand from our  competitors ) . i believe , at the moment , there are no bandwidth exchanges that  allow "" combinatorial "" bids . if we are the first one to do it , we might  improve our sale channel and gain some market share . ( note : auction - > one  seller and many buyers : exchange - > many sellers and many buyers . )  moreover , i think auctioning the unsold bandwidth will not hurt us because we  cannot sell them anyway . in addition , we ourselves can be a dummy bidder in  the system and bid in the auction . if the current wining bid is too low , we  can just over - bid it and keep the product . this way , we can indirectly put a  reserve price on the products .  let ' s meet sometime in the first week of january .  - chonawee",0

"Subject: california update 4 / 27 / 01  the following report contains confidential and sensitive information . please  treat with discretion .  executive summary :  ? ferc price cap decision reflects bush political and economic objectives .  politically , bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on davis ; from  an economic perspective , he is unwilling to create disincentives for new  power generation  ? davis finds four major flaws with ferc plan , most notably its exclusion of  out - of - state generators  ? june lst "" kill clause "" for ferc order could coincide with new bush regional  plan  ? california facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade , expected  $ 20 billion power bill this summer - - economic crisis would force deeper  administration involvement  ? qf bid for advance payments from pg & e likely to fail in bankruptcy court  ? new generation delays probable because of state / qf squabbling  ? consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to socal bailout  deal  1 . ferc fallout  the ferc decision is a holding move by the bush administration that looks  like action , but is not . rather , it allows the situation in california to  continue to develop virtually unabated . the political strategy appears to  allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where davis cannot escape  shouldering the blame . once they are politically inoculated , the  administration can begin to look at regional solutions . moreover , the  administration has already made explicit ( and will certainly restate in the  forthcoming cheney commission report ) its opposition to stronger price caps  on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the  construction of new generation .  it is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were  generally happy with the ferc order and that the only ferc commissioner who  favors price caps actually voted against this plan .  2 . something less than effective price caps  from davis ' s point of view , the ferc plan has four major flaws :  ? the order applies only to california , not to the rest of the west .  non - california generators are not required to sell at capped rates to  california .  ? as the order is written , it is more of a price floor for emergency power  than a ceiling .  ? state officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game  the system , because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a stage 2  emergency and does not require any collusion .  ? even when the price caps kick in , they are based on the cost - plus for the  highest cost producer supplying power to california and do not require  wholesalers to abide by the cap . the generators can also charge above the  cap , provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to ferc .  3 . proposal "" kill clause "" adds to the political dilemma for davis  the ferc proposal includes a "" kill clause "" that says the caps will be  withdrawn unless california ' s iso agrees by june lst to become part of the  regional grid now under ferc control . if davis doesn ' t sign on to the  regional grid by june lst , then he will have to live with june 2 nd headlines  blaming him for letting the "" bush price caps plan "" collapse .  4 . growing fiscal risk in california  sources speculate that california could therefore pay as much as $ 20 billion  on power this summer - this is more than the combined enterprise value of  pg & e and sce . these sources believe that , because of the severity of the  situation , the ferc and / or the federal government will be forced to take  further action to control prices for power .  the consensus is that the state of california will run out of money in about  90 days . one of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to  finance new power plant construction in exchange for long - term power deals .  the bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge  loans they are providing to california .  the bush administration and the fed are only now waking up to the seriousness  of the fiscal picture . the country ' s largest and most prosperous state will  have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating  deficits in a matter of months .  5 . qfs to seek advance payment from pg & e  meanwhile , on the bankruptcy front , the qfs reportedly will ask the  bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from pge ' s accounts ,  since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment for  gas . it appears very unlikely that the qfs ' request will be granted . if the  qfs do not receive advance payment , it is likely that most of the 4 , 000 mw  of gas - fired qf capacity will remain offline .  6 delays likely in new qf generation  the qf deals made with the state for long - term contracts are being  continually renegotiated , which is likely to mean that the new plants those  contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as anticipated .  7 . consumer groups ready to challenge constitutionality of sce bailout plan  harvey rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an  analysis of the mou for the sce bailout plan . the analysis was done by a  utilities analyst , rather than a lawyer , though it appears to raise a number  of good legal points . for example , one of the elements of the mou is a  "" non - bypassable "" charge on ratepayers that would require them to pay even  if they disconnect from the grid . this is effectively a tax , since there is  no exchange of value for money , which under the ca constitution cannot be  used to directly benefit a private entity . this makes the bonds that would  be issued are general obligation bonds , rather than revenue bonds . according  to the constitution , the state cannot be put into debt to benefit a private  company . for this and other reasons , even if the republicans would vote for  the sce bailout , which remains unlikely , the bailout probably would not  stand a likely constitutional challenge .  8 . governor hurt by continued failure to disclose long - term power contracts  the issue of the governor ' s failure to disclose the details of the long - term  power contracts continues to distress the other players in the crisis .  even if he were to disclose everything he and his staff have been  negotiating , it is likely that their actions and negotiations will  challenged , creating an even further delay .",0

"Subject: precious metals var  jason ,  after our brief discussion last night i think i should discuss a few of the  issues i have with respect to calculating a var on the deal that you are  proposing . the var model , as i illustrated , is set up to accept a term  structure of delta positions , prices and vols and it may be difficult to  translate the ' silver mine ' position into these inputs .  i do not think that we can simply take the net silver content of the mine and  then make some assumptions about vol and price . the var model  also assumes a certain amount of liquidity in the market and a 1 day holding  period .  to do this properly i would need to understand fully how the deal is priced  as these sensitivities are ultimately what will effect the change in mtm  in the future and that is essentially what var is supposed to predict .  if you need me to work on this then you need to contact steve who will help  to prioritise my time . i will also need to consult with vince kaminski and  tanya tamarachenko in houston for advice .  rac will also assist in the process .  please contact me if you have any further questions ,  kirstee  x 34529",0

""  there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of  the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) ,  will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it  address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just  to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ?  the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter  technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are  implementing this technology .  3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas  such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what  value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of  stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to  ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail .  the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual  customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful  history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute  averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the  distribution of load looks like .  i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our  concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these  topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be  reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe  in the form of a talk here at enron .  again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again  soon .  stinson  nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm  to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com  subject : stanford project  hello vince and stinson ,  first of all ,  best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !  if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together  some time to have dinner .  i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding  it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is  eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !  we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would  hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into  the "" problem / opportunity generation environment . "" that really helps the  student  to develop a realistic vision about their research .  perhaps , our whole team could visit enron again some time in the next quarter ,  say in march or so , to discuss the research issues we are pursuing . and of  course  you could visit us before that too .  with my warmest wishes ,  nick",0

- please correct me or suggest otherwise .  shalesh ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort . in addition to his effort  with your group , he is presently supporting jean mrha with pricing and  standardization for a traded storage maret -

"Subject: re : henwood query  hi karolina ,  yes , it might be more productive to talk on the phone . given our time  difference , why don ' t we plan on tomorrow ( friday ) 8 : 00 am pdt , 4 : 00 pm bdt ?  my number in the states is 503 - 464 - 8430 . give me your number , too , so that i  can call back if i get hung up in a meeting or something .  the situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the  capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour , but  in constructing the stack , increments of a plant may be scattered throughout  the stack , based on their respective incremental heat rates . ( this is why  increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model . ) results for  the capacity increments , however , are not available as output ; only each  plant ' s aggregate values are reported .  i had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a  homer city , ny plant we were studying a few years ago . attached is the sql  query you can import into ms access to do the same thing for you ( making  appropriate modifications to the year , hour , etc . ) unfortunately , no henwood  documentation on the output variables existed when i created this query , so i  can not really tell you what they represent anymore . an acquaintance of mine  at entergy and i were lobbying to get henwood to provide some documentation ,  so it may be available now .  let ' s talk and maybe we can help you out ,  michael  > > > karolina potter / lon / ect @ enron 08 / 24 / 00 07 : 08 am > > >  michael ,  i am an analyst in paul mead ' s continental power trading group in london . i  am currently working on the project , which requires the use of emss , and  experience some difficulties interpreting the output results . steven leppard  from our research group gave me your name as an expert in this system and  consequently the person to contact in case of problems .  i have been running simulations for the dutch market and was asked to provide  the traders with some front - end screen graphs in order to interpret the  numerical results . one of the graphs is to show an hourly generation stack  and system ' s marginal cost , as we only run cost based scenarios . to sort each  station ' s hourly generation i need its marginal cost . to my knowledge though ,  marginal cost is only generated for a systems marginal unit ( transarea  marginal units query , marg _ cost unit ) . therefore i was sorting the stations  according to the cost which i calculated based on the outputs from station  detail by hour query . the calculation was as follows :  for each hour , for each generating station :  "" marginal cost "" [ o / mwh ] = ( generation _ cost [ oo 00 ] * 1000 ) / generation [ mwh ] -  vom _ cost [ o / mwh ]  this i thought would include fuel cost and start up costs . however , a  marginal station which i get on the stack as a result of the above  calculation is not a station given in marginal station field in transarea  marginal units query . i have also looked into transarea _ data _ hr table and  transarea _ data table but non of the costs there match my results .  do you happen to know what formula is used to determine marg _ cost and which  outputs i should be using to obtain the right results ?  it might be easier if we could discuss this issue on the phone . in this case  could you please send me your direct telephone number . i am struggling  understanding what is going on and would appreciate your help very much .  regards  karolina  - text . htm  - stack generator sql . txt",0

"Subject: points for singh meet  vince ,  please find below a note i had prepared for wade cline who is meeting with a  representative of the prime minister ' s office tomorrow .  i think you may find these points useful .  additionally , i am attaching a copy of a small presentation i made , saturday  in mumbai on roadblocks in the power sector with special reference to wat  needs to be done to start trading ( & its benefits ) .  i have been working with the henwood team that arrived today , and i think a  good part of the data is now in place . i will be arranging meeting with some  officicals from the transmission side and gather any additional data there  too .  krishan got in last night ( i conveyed your best wishes to him ) . we will  hopefully have a useful day with henwood folks tomorrow . i look forward to  being in houston , possibly by the end of the coming week .  hope you and the team are doing well ! !  regards ,  sandeep .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by sandeep kohli / enron _ development on  01 / 15 / 2001 01 : 17 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  sandeep kohli  01 / 15 / 2001 01 : 17 am  to : wade cline / enron _ development @ enron _ development  cc :  subject : points for singh meet  wade ,  please find below a brief note on what i feel your tack should be with  n . k . singh ( who is supposed to be a hard negotiator ) . i am assuming here that  this will be more of an introductory meeting where both sides are feeling out  the other . the two meetings i had arranged over the weekend , would  hopefully , have given you a better idea of the thinking of at least these two  people o the issue .  incidentally , in the indian system , the governor of any state is a central  government nominee . he is the eyes and ears of the central govt . in the  state . please see basak ' s meeting in that light . the message he takes will  likely go directly to the pmo in delhi . i will therefore be working closely  to convey the right impression .  for n . k . singh clearly there are three things you would try to convey :  a description of the problem ,  some of the resultant consequences if it is not solved soon enough , and  conveying the fact that there are win - win solutions well within the goi ' s  power to implement , that would in fact enhance his reputation and the  country ' s as one that lives up to its reputation  i would be careful to make the point that we are not going to give up any  value , but are willing to be accomodative to mseb , gom , and goi needs , either  through financial re - engineering , or through getting direct access to the  market in some areas . this will also fly well with enron management that is  more comfortable with market risks than political .  describing the problem  dpc has a ppa , backed by goi mseb ' s  monthy collections not improving - are in the range of rs . 900 cr . / month  mseb , and gom clearly do not have the resources , in the short run ( 3 - 5 yrs . )  to meet these obligations ; hence central intervention is needed .  in a grid of 13000 mw ( maharashtra grid size ) , absorbing an additional 1440  mw ( phase ii ) at one go is difficult ; however if we take western region , grid  size is 42000 mw . clearly absorbing all the power in that framework is much  easier .  to this if we add northern and southern grids , we can probably evacuate out  another 500 - 700 mw through the interconnects . hence , there is definitely  value in looking at this issue at a national level .  additionally , it is not just solvable at that level , but actually answers to  the crying need for power in the country , and hence is a boon for the govt . ,  and should be treated as such .  consequences of not solving the problem  we can call upon the sovereign guarantee , which will cover our partial  payments . however , this would almost definitely lead to a deterioration of  the country ' s credit rating - put back incoming investments into the  petroleum sector ( where private participation program is about to be unveiled  in 25 o we need to get someone to negotiate with . please use  your good offices to quickly form a representative group that includes  central , state govt . , and seb representatives so that we can work on the  solution .  without active participation from pm ' s office , we are likely to waste  precious time bouncing between the seb , gom , and various ministries of goi .  hope this helps .  regards ,  sandeep .",0

"Subject: data for moody ' s riskcalc  craig and kim ,  as you know , i have obtained a 60 day trial subscription to moody ' s  riskcalc .  you wanted to know if it makes sense for enron to purchase riskcalc .  well , after plowing through their 100 page manual and sitting through  today ' s 2 - hour moody ' s presentation , it is necessary for us to have  information about enron ' s counterparties to move to the next step with  riskcalc .  we have obtained some information on enron ' s european counterparties from  our colleagues in the london office .  we need for you and / or your colleagues in the houston office to supply us  with a list of enron ' s north american counterparties .  more specifically , to evaluate moody ' s riskcalc we will need the following  financial inputs for enron ' s north american ( private firm ) counterparties :  fiscal year  the prior twelve months of financial data are represented . annual statements  are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables ,  such as cost of goods sold , net income , sales , and ebit . the value should be  a four - digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or  2000 . forecasts until the year 2009 can be made . a constant rate of inflation  is applied to future years using last year ' s ( 1999 ) inflation level . in  general this ' estimation error ' will not cause any great problems , as size  affects default rates at very large scales ( e . g . , $ 10 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 000 , 000  makes a significant difference , $ 1 , 000 , 000 vs . $ 1 , 050 , 00 does not ) .  cash & equivalents  this measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities .  inventory  inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet , in thousands dollars ,  without any alterations for accounting method ( e . g . , lifo , fifo , average  cost ) . this item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and  supplies purchased for use in production of revenue . specifically this would  include purchase cost , sales cost , sales taxes , transportation costs ,  insurance costs , and storage costs .  current assets  this item primarily represents cash , inventories , accounts receivables ,  marketable securities , and other current assets .  total assets  total assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars .  for example , $ 15 , 500 , 000 should be entered as 15500 . specifically , total  assets are the sum of current assets plus net property , plant , and equipment  plus other noncurrent assets ( including intangible assets , deferred items ,  and investments and advances ) . leave previous year ' s total assets blank for  australian companies .  current liabilities  liabilities are positive values . included in current liabilities are  short - term debt , accounts payable , and other current liabilities .  total liabilities  this balance sheet account , total liabilities , is a positive number  representing the sum of current liabilities plus long - term debt plus other  noncurrent liabilities ( including deferred taxes , investment tax credit , and  minority interest ) .  retained earnings  retained earnings , a historical measure of performance , is the cumulative  earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders .  typically , it is the prior year ' s retained earnings plus net income less  distributions . retained earnings are generally positive . some firms with low  credit quality will have negative retained earnings . leave this field blank  for australian companies .  sales  this item consists of the industry segment ' s gross sales ( the amount of  actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period )  reduced by cash discounts , trade discounts , and returned sales and allowances  for which credit is given to customers .  cost of goods sold  entered in thousands of dollars , this value is generally a positive number  less than sales . it represents all costs directly allocated by the company to  production , such as material , labor , and overhead . not fixed overhead or  items that would be included in selling , general , and administrative  expenses . leave this field blank for australian companies .  ebit  earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation . it  can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income .  interest expense  this item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short -  and long - term debt . typically , we expect this charge to be approximately the  prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities . one measure of  computing this is : interest expense = 0 . 07 * total liabilities .  net income  this item represents the income ( or loss ) reported by a company after  expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the  fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations . a  loss is represented by a negative sign . for example , a $ 5 , 000 , 000 loss would  be entered as - 5000 . leave previous year ' s net income blank for australian  companies .  extraordinary items  positive or negative , this item represents unusual items that sometimes  appear on the income statement . the items are designated by the company as  extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and  discontinued operations . these items include extraordinary gains / losses ,  income ( loss ) from discontinued operations , and cumulative affect of  accounting changes . expenses are entered as negative values , gains as  positive values . leave previous year ' s extraordinary items blank for  australian companies .  country  this model is calibrated for the united states , canada , and australia .  we look forward to receiving this information for enron ' s private firm north  american counterparties so that we can move on to the next step with the  evaluation of riskcalc .  thanks ,  iris",0

"Subject: jcc  good morning . i apologize for the response delay . i ' ve gone back through  the analysis that i did back in april , and have thrown around some ideas with  vince and stinson . the issue may be summarized as follows .  the hedge relationship was derived using jcc and prompt brent , and is valid  for jcc and prompt brent . no problems here . however , it will not be valid  for points far out on the forward curve . intuitively , this hedge  relationship will approach one as we move far out on the curve , but since  there is no data , i can not statistically determine this . one can imagine a  term structure of heding ratios that start at 0 . 67 and move to 1 . 0 , so that  the back end of the curves would move together , but how fast it converges to  one is anyone ' s guess .  if there is a way of determining the historical jcc forward curve , then the  hedge relationships may be estimated . however , i have been unable to  determine a rigorous approach to building the jcc curve .  i can explain this far better in person , and would like to talk as soon as  possible at your convenience .  - kevin kindall",0

"Subject: california update 5 / 4 / 01  if you have any questions , please contact kristin walsh at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510 .  bridge loan financing bills may not meet their may 8 th deadline due to lack of support  sources report there will not be a vote regarding the authorization for the bond issuance / bridge loan by the may 8 th deadline . any possibility for a deal has reportedly fallen apart . according to sources , both the republicans and democratic caucuses are turning against davis . the democratic caucus is reportedly "" unwilling to fight "" for davis . many legislative republicans and democrats reportedly do not trust davis and express concern that , once the bonds are issued to replenish the general fund , davis would "" double dip "" into the fund . clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and the governor . however , it is believed once davis discloses the details of the power contracts negotiated , a bond issuance will take place . additionally , some generator sources have reported that some of the long - term power contracts ( as opposed to those still in development ) require that the bond issuance happen by july 1 , 2001 . if not , the state may be in breach of contract . sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge loan legislation by may 8 th , having a bond issuance by july lst will be very difficult .  the republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state would "" eat "" the $ 5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the general fund , thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $ 8 billion . however , the reportedly now are not going to offer even this concession . sources report that the republicans intend to hold out for full disclosure of the governor ' s plan for handling the crisis , including the details and terms of all long - term contracts he has negotiated , before they will support the bond issuance to go forward .  currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan ; ab 8 x and ab 31 x . ab 8 x authorizes the dwr to sell up to $ 10 billion in bonds . this bill passed the senate in march , but has stalled in the assembly due to a lack of republican support . ab 31 x deals with energy conservation programs for community college districts . however , sources report this bill may be amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by senator bowen , currently in ab 8 x . senator bowen ' s language states that the state should get paid before the utilities from rate payments ( which , if passed , would be likely to cause a socal bankruptcy ) .  according to sources close to the republicans in the legislature , republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money available in the general fund . for instance , tony strickland has stated that only 1 / 2 of the bonds ( or approximately $ 5 billion ) should be issued . other republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds . the republicans intend to bring this up in debate on monday . additionally , lehman brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and there are some indications that lehman may back out of the bridge loan .  key points of the bridge financing  initial loan amount : $ 4 . 125 b  lenders : jp morgan $ 2 . 5 b  lehman brothers $ 1 . 0 b  bear stearns $ 625 m  tax exempt portion : of the $ 4 . 125 b ; $ 1 . 6 b is expected to be tax - exempt  projected interest rate : taxable rate 5 . 77 %  tax - exempt rate 4 . 77 %  current projected  blended ir : 5 . 38 %  maturity date : august 29 , 2001  for more details please contact me at ( 713 ) 853 - 9510  bill sb 6 x passed the senate yesterday , but little can be done at this time  the senate passed sb 6 x yesterday , which authorizes $ 5 billion to create the california consumer power and conservation authority . the $ 5 billion authorized under sb 6 x is not the same as the $ 5 billion that must be authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased , or the additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing power going forward . again , the republicans are not in support of these authorizations . without the details of the long - term power contracts the governor has negotiated , the republicans do not know what the final bond amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to support . no further action can be taken regarding the implementation of sb 6 x until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid for purchasing power . also , there is no staff , defined purpose , etc . for the california public power and conservation authority . however , this can be considered a victory for consumer advocates , who began promoting this idea earlier in the crisis .  socal edison and bankruptcy  at this point , two events would be likely to trigger a socal bankruptcy . the first would be a legislative rejection of the mou between socal and the governor . the specified deadline for legislative approval of the mou is august 15 th , however , some decision will likely be made earlier . according to sources , the state has yet to sign the mou with socal , though socal has signed it . the republicans are against the mou in its current form and davis and the senate lack the votes needed to pass . if the legislature indicates that it will not pas the mou , socal would likely file for voluntary bankruptcy ( or its creditor - involuntary ) due to the lack operating cash .  the second likely triggering event , which is linked directly to the bond issuance , would be an effort by senator bowen to amend sb 31 x ( bridge loan ) stating that the dwr would received 100 % of its payments from ratepayers , then the utilities would receive the residual amount . in other words , the state will get paid before the utilities . if this language is included and passed by the legislature , it appears likely that socal will likely file for bankruptcy . socal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and the dwr proportionately from rate payments .",0

"Subject: re : corn subsidy govt program analysis  vasant ,  thanks . let ' s contact wharton next week .  vince  from : vasant shanbhogue / enron @ enronxgate on 04 / 25 / 2001 10 : 15 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : nelson neale / na / enron @ enron  subject : corn subsidy govt program analysis  hi vince ,  nelson and i had a meeting yesterday with the ag desk folks on how to go  forward on the analysis and presentation for this program . the consensus  from the ag side was that the choice of university will be highly politically  driven , ie preferably the university should be from a state that has close  ties to sympathetic senators or other political figures . also it is  preferable if the university faculty have worked on ag issues before , lending  more credibility in the ag community . the names that came up were  mississippi state and texas a & m . nelson knows of a person at mississippi  state who worked with the usda on risk management issues .  the needed analysis itself is not necessarily very deep , and the focus is  primarily to get a non - quantitative presentation out that outlines how enron  can take on the downside risk of local crop prices ( enron probably needs to  cover actual local prices and not simply an index because i do not think the  govt will want to worry about basis risk ) .  the pilot program itself will be very small , and lends itself to continuing  down the path of short term trading rather than long term origination .  another thought on hedging our potential short positon ( on the origination  side ) is that the govt program can only provide a partial hedge to the extent  of the premium received - - we still have unlimited downside from the short .  vasant  p . s . i am writing up jim bouillion ' s project suggestion as a potential  project for wharton . of course , we may still ask wharton for their insights  on the corn price protection approach .",0

"Subject: a basic idea of price - offer matching clauses  vince -  here is the basic idea i was alluding to :  suppose a car dealer promised to "" match any advertised price . "" then his  competitor would feel the need to respond in kind . and so on , until all  dealers advertised they would "" match any advertised price . "" now , consider one  of these dealer ' s decision to perhaps lower his prices . if he does so ,  everyone will immediately match his price , so his market share will remain  unchanged , at whatever it was before , but his revenues ( and all other dealers  as well ) would be lowered by the amount of his price reduction . so , the  dealer rationally decides not to lower his prices to try to sell more cars .  now , suppose a limited partnership , where the partners contract to "" control ""  who they are in business with , by putting a "" right of first refusal "" clause  into the partnership ' s papers , whereby any partner wishing to sell his  interests must offer the remaining partners the right to match any offer the  partner received from outside for his shares . now , suppose you are an  outsider , considering doing your due diligence in the thought you might want  to buy into the partnership . you know if your offer is a "" good "" one from your  perspective , offering you the prospects of a fair rate of return , the  existing partners will match it , and you will get nothing in the deal but you  will have paid , from your own pocket , for your due diligence . conversely , if  you offer too much for the shares , then the other partners will not match  your offer and you will then realize you overpaid . in neither case can you  credibly assume you know more about the business than do the current  partners . so , you ( basically ) don ' t make an offer . so , a partner ' s shares  are seriously devalued by his partners having the right to match any offers  he receives for them . the "" right of first refusal "" clause precludes  economically efficient rebalancing of portfolios by rendering the shares  ( essentially ) illiquid .  clayton",0

( although it will probably be clear from our discussions the  model ( s ) we ? prefer ) . we therefore try and give ? as clear account as possible  of the advantage and disadvantages of all the ? models so that the reader can  make an informed choice as to the models which ? best suit their needs .  in order to meet our objectives the ? book is divided into 11 chapters . ? in  chapter 1 we give an overview of the fundamental principals needed to ?  model and  price energy derivatives which will underpin the remainder of the ? book . in  addition to introducing ? the techniques that underlie the black - scholes  modelling framework we outline ? the numerical techniques of trinomial trees  and  monte carlo simulation for ? derivative pricing , which are used throughout the  book .  in chapter 2 we discuss the ? analysis of spot energy prices . as ? well as  analysing empirical price movements we propose a number of processes ? that  can  be used to model the prices . ? we look at the well - know process of geometric  brownian motion as well as ? mean reversion , stochastic volatility and jump  processes , discussing each and ? showing how they can be simulated and their  parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince ? kaminski , grant masson and ronnie chahal of  enron  corp . , discusses volatility ? estimation in energy commodity markets . ? this  chapter builds on the previous one . it examines in detail the methods , ?  merits  and pitfalls of the volatility estimation process assuming different ? pricing  models introduced in chapter 2 . ? examples from crude , gas , and electricity  markets are used to illustrate ? the technical and interpretative aspects of  calculating volatility .  chapter 4 examines forward curves ? in the energy markets . although ? such  curves  are well understood and straight - forward in the most financial ? markets , the  difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well ? defined  curves .  in this chapter we ? describe forward price bounds for energy prices and the  building of forward ? curves from market instruments . we ? outline the three  main  approaches which have been applied to building forward ? curves in energy  markets ; the arbitrage approach , the econometric approach , and ? deriving  analytical values by modelling underlying stochastic factors .  chapter 5 presents an overview of ? structures found in the energy derivative  markets and discusses their uses . examples of products analysed in this  chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors and collars , as well as  energy  swaptions , compound options , asian options , barrier options , lookback  options ,  and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and ? multi - factor models of the energy spot  price  and the pricing of some standard ? energy derivatives . closed form ? solutions  for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option prices ? both on  the spot and forwards are derived and presented for all the models in ? this  chapter including a three factor , stochastic convenience yield and interest  rate model .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of ? path dependent and american style options  can  be evaluated for the models in ? chapter 6 . simulation schemes are ? developed  for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a variety ? of  path  dependent options . in order ? to price options which incorporate early  exercise  opportunities , a trinomial ? tree scheme is developed . this tree ? is built to  be  consistent with the observed forward curve and can be used to ? price exotic  as  well as standard european and american style options .  chapter 8 describes a methodology ? for valuing energy options based on  modelling  the whole of the market observed ? forward curve . the approach results ? in a  multi - factor model that is able to realistically capture the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves . ? the user defined volatility structures  can be of an extremely general ? form . closed - form solutions are ? developed  for  pricing standard european options , and efficient monte carlo ? schemes are  presented for pricing exotic options . the chapter closes with a discussion of  the valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk ? management of energy derivative positions . ?  in  this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions ? that  trade options or other derivatives and who are then faced with the problem ?  of  managing the risk through time . ? we begin with delta hedging a portfolio  containing derivatives and look ? at extensions to gamma hedging ?  illustrating  the techniques using both spot and ? forward curve models . the general ? model  presented in chapter 8 is ideally suited to multi - factor hedging of a ?  portfolio  of energy derivatives and this is also discussed .  chapter 10 examines the key risk ? management concept of value at risk ( var )  applied to portfolios containing ? energy derivative products . after ?  discussing  the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs ? ( volatilities ,  covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then compare the fours  major ? methodologies for computing var ; delta , delta - gamma , historical  simulation and ? monte - carlo simulation , applying each to the same portfolio  of  energy ? options . in this chapter we also ? look at testing the var estimates  for  various underlying energy market ? variables .  finally , in chapter 11 we review ? modelling approaches to credit risk . ? we  look  in detail at two quite different approaches , creditmetrics ( j . p . morgan  ( 1997 ) )  and ? creditrisk + ( credit suisse financial ? products ( 1997 ) ) for which  detailed  information is publicly available . together these provide an extensive set ?  of  tools with which to measure credit risk . we present numerical examples of  applying these techniques to energy derivatives .  before ? we begin we stress that the models and methods we present in this  book  are tools ? which should be used with the benefit of an understanding of how  both  the ? tool ? ? and the market works . the ? techniques we describe are certainly  not  ? magic wands ? which can be waved at ? data and risk management problems to  provide instant and perfect solutions . to quote from the riskmetrics  technical  document ? ? no amount of sophisticated analytics will replace experience and  professional judgement in managing risk . ? . ? however , the right tools ,  correctly  used make the job a lot ? easier !",0

thanks for the update . what i am not sure of is what if any decision  has to be  made on may 19 . it seems to me that the mystic lady and elba island deals  have already  been approved and executed - but it is quite likely i am missing a detail or  two .  john  vince j kaminski  15 / 05 / 2000 17 : 14  to : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , david gorte / hou / ect @ ect , rick  buy / hou / ect @ ect , ted murphy / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : lng may 19 decision  john ,  this is the update on what i have done for the lng transactions .  1 . i was not involved in the lng ship project . i shall read the dash  and give you my comments . without looking at the details , i think that the  decision  to charter a tanker removes one significant risk we have at the elba island  project ( please , see point 2 ) .  2 . elba island . i am working with doug rotenberbg , brad hitch , scott earnest  ( sally beck ' s organization ) and rac to set up the book for the elba island  transaction . the next step  will be to expand the book to capture all the enron ' s lng - related positions  in one place and  to look for natural risk offsets and possible hedges . a working group is  meeting to close a few  remaining gaps tomorrow ( tuesday ) at 8 : 30 .  a few comments on the book design and my view of the project :  a . the current thinking is that lng will be sourced for the elba island  facility  by buying marginal cargos on the fob basis . marginal cargos will represent  supply from excess capacity that has not been committed under long - term  contracts or became available due to some short - term frictions .  the fob cargos are typically selling at a significant discount to the  long - term  contract prices . the economics of the deal , as represented by the book we are  setting up , will reflect the assumption that not only we can locate marginal  cargos  but that we shall be able to do it on a regular basis , arranging shipping and  coordinating  the facility schedule and natural gas transactions in the us . in other words ,  we have a significant logistical and operational risk in this transaction .  b . the transaction will cover the period of 17 years ( with an extension  option of  5 years ) . even if we can lock - in the lng volumes over this time period , we  have no ability to lock - in the other side of the spread ( us gas prices ) for  such a long tenor . this is  essentially a tolling transaction with exposure to the lng - nat gas spread  and  i would not recommend locking - in only one leg of the spread .  one solution would be to cover , let ' s say , 50 % of he lng volumes for the  first  5 years and lock - in the nat gas side on the us market side .  c . the book we are setting up will be based on many managerial assumptions  regarding sources of lng , shipping rates , schedules , etc . i would set up a  big prudence reserve  in case we mark it to market .  d . my group will work on valuation of some options we have in the elba island  deal  ( that are good for enron ) and on the hedging strategy for the lng positions .  long - term lng contracts are typically based on the japanese crude cocktail  that  correlates very well with brent .  vince  john sherriff  05 / 14 / 2000 01 : 40 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : lauren urquhart / lon / ect @ ect  subject : lng may 19 decision  vince  i haven ' t spoken to you for awhile but hope the world is treating you well .  anyway with greg moving to his  new role i have ( i hope only temporarily ) staff trading oversight for the  eastern hemishere plus lng .  i understand that your group is taking a first cut at developing curves for  lng and lng ship values . i also understand  that another lng ship decision is on the dockets for may 19 ( not very far  away ) . anway i understand this  is a big decision but i still have gotten very little info yet . can you  please let me know where you stand now ?  i will ask my assistant lauren to set up a time that i can speak with you in  the next couple of days and if you  have anything for me to review before then she can get it faxed to me as well .  look forward to connecting with you vince .  john",0

"Subject: alp proposal  carrie ,  i am sending you , as promised , the draft of my proposal . please , let me know  if it meets your requirements . i shall be glad to revise it and send you the  final version .  vince kaminski  * * * * * * * * * *  one of the most important trends in the energy industry during the last year  was proliferation of electronic , internet based , trading platforms for  wholesale markets and for retail operations . websites such as  www . houstonstreet . com and www . altranet . com provide facilities for matching  buyers and sellers . the website operated by enron corp . ( enrononline )  represents an alternative solution under which enron acts as a principal in  every transaction . on the retail ? side , many retail e - commerce companies  offering auctions , reverse auctions and platforms for creation of buyers  ,  clubs challenge incumbent utilities . the objective of this project is to  evaluate the impact of e - commerce ( both at the wholesale and retail levels )  on the energy industry . the study will start with comparative analysis of  different wholesale trading and retail e - commerce business models and  evaluation of their long - term viability . the next step will be assessment of  the impact of e - commerce on price dynamics , profit margins and the level of  competition in different energy markets . a separate section will be devoted  to analysis of reaction of companies and organizations affected by e - commerce  ( incumbent utilities , organized exchanges , energy brokers ) to the new  competitive threat , and different strategies they implement to meet the  challenge . organized exchanges have accelerated in many cases the transition  to screen - based trading that has been already replacing open outcry  technology . power and natural gas marketers have created alliances ( with  other industry players , software companies and electronic exchanges ) to  create their own trading platforms . gas and electric utilities embarked on  development of vertical and horizontal e - commerce platforms , offering  services to households and other companies in the energy industry . the  critical question is how quickly different companies should react to the  competitive threats and how fast they should exploit opportunities created by  the internet based economy . it ' s quite obvious that the internet revolution  will change the energy industry ' s landscape during the next few years . the  objective of the project is to provide answers to the questions posed above ,  based on the currently available information . additionally , the participants  should come up with fallback strategies the energy companies should implement  in case the currently ? expected trends fail to materialize .   _",0

"" the investment  was too good to pass up , and other kids were throwing their  lunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes . of course  when "" next week "" rolled around and i couldn ' t pony up the cash ,  i promised to pay them even more the week after that ,  if they would just let me keep their investment a little bit  longer .  eventually the end of the year came and went , high school  started and with it came girls , and homework , and parties ,  and sports , and those poor kids from eighth grade had more  things on their mind than last year ' s lunch money .  i made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid ,  and i didn ' t even get beat up .  hidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market  secrets you will ever learn .  first of all , greed is your number one enemy . you ' re not  going to turn $ 2 into $ 5 in a week , so cash out when  you ' re ahead . don ' t wait for the boat to sink before  grabbing the lifejacket .  second , never trust an investment adviser of any kind .  they are looking out for their own money , not yours .  the "" professionals "" , those stuffy investment counselors and  money managers , will always tell you that the best time to  buy is now . according to those guys , the longer you keep  your money in the market , the more money you ' re going to make .  ask them when is the best time to sell and their answer is  "" never "" .  in a sense , they are right . if you put $ 250 , 000 in an index  fund right now , you ' ll probably have over a million dollars  in thirty or forty years . but here ' s the problem :  do you want to wait thirty or forty years to be rich ?  hell no !  you want the money now - so you can enjoy it . it ' s hard to  make use of your fortune when you ' re seventy years old  in a wheelchair . if you could make a million dollars in  the next few years , what would you do with it ? where would  you travel ? what kind of car would you buy ?  the fact is . . . youth is the best time to be rich .  if your goal is to make quick profits in the market , volatility  is your ally , and stability your enemy . you want to see  those large upswings , two hundred points in a day , followed  by the four hundred point crash a week later . you don ' t  care if the market went up or down 20 % this year as long  it was unstable . that ' s how you ' re going to make the  money .  what i ' m talking about here is day trading .  my father invests the traditional way ; he holds some good stocks  and he goes up 30 k and down 30 k . in the long term of 5 - 10 years  he makes money .  the day trader buys or sells 5 , 000 shares of xyz for a  $ 25 , 000 profit in a 5 - 10 minute trade . he acts quickly , taking  advantage of all the information at his disposal about a  certain stock , and estimating whether it will go up or  down within hours , sometimes within minutes .  i can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing  amounts of money at it . it ' s not rocket science , and you  only need to learn a few basic principles to get started .  society would have you believe that successful trading is  complicated and requires formal training .  the truth is , wealthy people use very simple investment  strategies to make money .  popular media and investment professionals portray successful  trading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing  ring . they don ' t want the competetion - and they sure as hell  don ' t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm  to execute a trade for which they ' d charge you forty or fifty  dollars .  they make their money only if you believe two lies :  1 ) that investing is too difficult and risky for the average  person .  2 ) that using an investment adviser who charges a high  commission is safer than trading online for a few bucks  per trade .  here is what the financial gurus in today ' s society absolutely ,  positively do not want you to know . . .  the strategies for profitable day trading are in fact  so simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend  a few hours of studying .  after reading over 200 financial books and publications  during the past decade , and after using day trading  to successfully make more than four million dollars in  the stock market , i ' ve learned the following lessons :  * * achieving financial success is incredibly simple .  * * anyone can do it .  * * it only takes a few hours to learn .  when i discovered the secret to day trading , i didn ' t become  wealthy overnight . if you want instant cash , drive to wal - mart .  buy a ski mask and a shotgun , and rob your local bank . the  only way to get rich , quick or otherwise , is through  hard work , knowledge , and determination .  after learning the fundamentals of day trading , i started  practicing the trading art itself , and the first few weeks  brought modest gains . the next few months gave me the practical  experience i needed to really earn a living , and i was pulling  close to a six figure income . in less than three years with no  formal financial training , minimal effort and only moderate risk ,  i had made my first million . the knowledge that i gained  during those formative trading years i am willing to share  with you in my new book , the master trader . you will learn from  my mistakes , and from my successes , as i teach you the simple ,  secret formula for day trading that i ' ve used profitably  year after year .  the income of the day trader can be staggering . thousands , even  hundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within  minutes . the difference between making money and losing your  shirt is simply this : knowledge . i will provide that knowledge ,  and i will give you a winning edge at this high - stakes game .  average income of a day trader :  5 % average an income in excess of $ 500 , 000 per year  22 % average an income in excess of $ 250 , 000 per year  35 % average an income in excess of $ 100 , 000 per year .  27 % average an income between $ 50 , 000 and $ 99 , 999 per year  11 % average an income between $ 20 , 000 and $ 49 , 999 per year  after reading the master trader , you will discover extremely  profitable , simple yet powerful trading methods that give  you an almost unfair trading advantage and make you  win despite the current market weakness .  here is just a snippet of what i will teach you :  * * * make money whether a stock goes up or down .  * * * learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds .  * * * learn exactly what stocks to trade , the exact price to  buy them and the exact price to sell them .  * * * save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the  mistakes beginners make .  * * * learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money  consistently in every market !  * * * learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance  for great success .  * * * profit on huge intraday price swings .  * * * make money on the biggest news stories .  * * * actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum  returns .  * * * learn how to use the tools and information wall street  professionals use .  * * * learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind .  it ' s time to ask yourself : "" am i going to listen to the  professionals who say buy buy buy but never sell ? or am  i going to take control of my own financial future , and  start making money right now in the stock market ? ""  who is looking out for your best economic interests - some  wealthy wall street stockbroker , or yourself ?  with the master trader e - book , you will learn everything you  need to know in order to get started with day trading . . . from  choosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the  lowest commissions and instant order executions to professional  trading strategies that make professional traders millions of  dollars .  the master trader e - book is the most comprehensive yet easy to  understand and straight - forward book ever written about active  trading . if you are serious about success in short term stock  trading - order today and start paving the road to your  own financial future .  oh , and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade ?  his high school friends laughed when he said he was going to  make money in the stock market .  six years later , he bought a beach - front home on the california  coast - with cash . oops , they weren ' t laughing anymore .  in a rollercoaster market like we have today , day trading  is the fastest track to wealth . if you ' re looking  for a long - term retirement investment with no risk  that goes up 5 % a year , then by all means , this ain ' t  your kind of game .  but if you want the quickest possible way to make a fortune  in the market , with the lowest element of risk , then  order the master trader e - book right now . i promise  to teach you all of the secrets that helped me become a  millionaire through successful day trading .  you don ' t need to know anything about the market , and  anyone can do it , with minimum effort . it ' s an easy  game to win if you know how the pieces move .  order the master trader e - book right now for only $ 49 . 97  by clicking on the link below :  http : / / 4 tools 4 life . com / qs  our company is strictly opposed to unsolicited emails .  to be removed from this list , please send an email  to "" bulkexpert @ yahoo . com "" ",1

"Subject: california power 1 / 19 / 00  1 . legislation passes - short - term measures , very long - term measures  as we said yesterday , sb - 7 x passed the california state senate easily . the  bill gives the state the immediate authority to purchase power via the  department of water and resources until february 2 nd . the department will  have $ 400 million available to finance power purchases , but there  expectations that these costs could easily rise to $ 1 billion by next week .  ab - 1 x has evolved into a longer - term solution and in its current form , would  authorize the department of water and resources to enter into long - term  contracts ( as opposed to the 15 day contracts in sb - 7 x ) to buy power at a  price cap of 5 . 5 cents per kw / h . this legislation is not expected to pass  today and will likely be changed considerably during the upcoming two week  period covered by sb - 7 x , when negotiations between generators , the utilities ,  and the state are likely to resume .  a second piece of legislation under - - sb 6 x - - has created uncertainty in the  markets . this legislation will create a california public power authority  with bond issuance authority . the uncertainty concerns whether the new  authority will address the problem of the $ 12 billion in outstanding debt  owed by the utilities . the current text of the legislation focuses only on  longer term measures such as expanding generation capacity and improving  efficiency . yet the legislation also says "" the authority may issue bonds ,  exercise power of eminent domain , and enter into joint power agreements and  buy , own , and sell land and facilities necessary for the financing of a  project . "" the general nature of this language leaves open the possibility of  either issuing bonds to finance past debts , or using eminent domain or the  bond authority to finance the utilities as they enter into a ch . 11 proceeding .  2 . default update  3 . bush  as we reported on wednesday , the bush administration continues to demonstrate  little interest in getting involved",0
"Subject: hurricane warning derivatives  folks ,  this note is intended to update all who may be concerned on our progress  toward developing a commercial hurricane warning derivative product or line  of products .  it is clear that numerous entities have underlying exposures to hurricane  warning frequency and / or duration . it is our objective to develop derivative  products that will enable these entities to effectively hedge this  exposure . we have generated a partial brainstorm - style list of whom natural  counterparties might be according to their underlying exposure :  pro - hurricane anti - hurricane  the weather channel resorts  home depot cruise ships  lowes riverboat casinos  cnn chemical plants and refineries  local tv stations u . s armed forces  dry ice manufacturers athletic teams  chainsaw manufacturers city governments  insect repellant manufacturers state governments  it is obvious that there are numerous naturally offsetting parties but it is  important to note that the pro - hurricane entities are more macro in nature  while the anti - hurricane entities are typically more regional . thus , we have  documented the frequency and duration data by regional location with the  thought that the anti - hurricane entities would be interested in regional  products and the pro - hurricane entities would likely be more interested in  bundled regional products depending on their exposure .  thus far , we have collected and documented all u . s hurricane warning data  from 1980 - 2000 in the form of an excel database . the data can be sorted by  year , storm , or location on the u . s coastline . total hurricane warning  duration as well as number of discrete hurricane warnings are the primary  data sets of interest for any given location ( or year or storm ) . the u . s  coast has been divided into 11 different geographic regions of roughly  similar size . these regions are : new england , mid - atlantic , virginia , north  carolina , georgia / south carolina , east florida , west florida , florida  panhandle , orleans / miss / bama , lousiana , and texas .  while this data set may not yet be sufficient for price modeling purposes , it  has confirmed our expectation that hurricane warning frequency and duration  is quite volatile and unpredictable . it is believed that this volaility ,  when graphically depicted and mathematically represented , could be used to  effectively demonstrate to would - be customers the impact of hurricane warning  frequency on their business financials . in many cases , businesses may be  well aware of their exposure but may not have quantified it and certainly  probably felt as if this was a risk they would have to wear themselves .  as we move forward on the modeling front , the data will certainly need to be  scrutinized to correct for any skewing factors such as political trends ,  satellite availability , population trends , etc . additionally , we need to go  further back in time so long as the accuracy doesn ' t decline .  on the marketing front , i am certainly open to ideas . it is believed the  weather channel would be the most natural party for such a product . given  our positive relationship that we currently have with them , they might be the  easiest sell . any and all ideas are welcome with regard to how and when  we should approach customers .  please respond with any questions , comments or concerns on this project .  thanks ,  charlie",0

"" in last november itself , mseb had sent an official intimation to the state  government informing its decision in favour of cancellation of the two  projects on several grounds - - including they being unviable and  unaffordable , "" sources said . "" reliance ' s project is no different from that of  dpc ' s . patalganga is also naphtha - based and its ppa is on similar lines . . .  after the enron experience , mseb cannot even dream of another gas - based  power plant in the state , "" a senior mseb official said . he said mseb has  already asked the state government not to provide escrow to both the 447 - mw  patalganga and the 1 , 084 - mw coal - based bhadravati , "" as the us energy major  has almost squeezed us of all over finances "" . when contacted , mseb chairman  vinay bansal said : "" reliance and ispat projects have been put on hold as per  the godbole committee ' s recommendations "" , but expressed inability to give  further details .  currently , bhadravati and patalganga projects have been put on hold as per  godbole committee report , which was set up to review the dpc - mseb ppa and  energy scenario in maharashtra . "" can you go ahead with the project without an  escrow cover ? "" the committee was believed to have asked ispat and reliance  representatives , to which the reply had been negative , sources added .  sources said , as of now , both the projects have not been able to achieve  financial closure as leading financial institutions were not willing to  fund the projects which do not have a "" guaranteed payment "" mechanism from  mseb , which , incidentally it has promised to dpc . "" all the three were cleared  as ' fast - track ' projects , but other than enron , reliance and ispat have been  caught in a quagmire , especially bhadravati , which has been hanging afire  since last nine years , "" they added .  moreover , the mseb official opined that given the current situation , if dpc  calls it quits from india , bhadravati was a safer bet than reliance ' s  patalganga . patalganga ' s power would be mere 50 paise less than that of dpc ' s  that ranges anywhere around approximately rs 4 . 50 per unit to as high as rs  7 , while bhadravati ' s cost could be around rs 3 . 80 to rs 4 per unit , he  informed . mseb ' s installed capacity ended on march 31 , 2001 , wasl 4 , 000 mw and  it has generated 45 , 000 million units with transmission and distribution  losses as high as 39 per cent .

""  irrespective of urgency of this approval to us , the best thing is that we are  getting the approval without draft electricity bill , 2001 being finalised . as  most of you are aware , initially the proposal was stalled at fipb level  pending finalisation of electricity bill . then it has gone to group of  ministers who had taken a positive approach and now the cabinet has cleared  it .  now fipb either issue an approval to enron llc or advise us to avail  automatic route . we will have one of it , culminating great team work .  seethayya",0
